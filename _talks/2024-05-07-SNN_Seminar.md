I held an introductory seminar on Spiking Neural Networks targeted to students of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course at the University of Padova. The seminar covered the basic concepts of SNNs, the main differences with respect to traditional ANNs, and a small introduction to the STDP learning rule and its properties. The slides are available [here]()
